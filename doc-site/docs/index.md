# Resonance Designs – Slint UI Component Kit

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.10-orange)

A reusable collection of Slint UI components designed for audio tools, sequencers, and creative applications.

Built with a focus on:

- Clean, modern aesthetics
- Audio-centric controls (VU meters, knobs, sequencer cells)
- Dynamic theming support
- Simple integration into existing Slint projects

## Getting Started

To use these components in your Slint project, you can import them from the library:

```slint
import { RDSKnob, RDSVUMeter } from "rds-slint-ui-kit/components/index.slint";

VerticalLayout {
    RDSKnob {
        size: 60px;
        min-value: 0;
        max-value: 127;
    }
    RDSVUMeter {
        level: 0.65;
    }
}
```

See [Theming](theming.md) for details on customizing the look and feel.

## Installation (Planned)

This library is intended to be distributed via:

- **npm**: for Slint + JS / WASM projects
- **Cargo**: for Rust + Slint projects

## Roadmap

- [x] npm package with .slint exports
- [x] Rust crate wrapping Slint resources
- [x] Theming support
- [ ] Additional UI components
